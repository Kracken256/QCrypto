# QCrypto - Cryptographic Algorithm Implementations

## Overview

Welcome to QCrypto, a repository dedicated to the implementation of cryptographic algorithms in C. The primary objective of this project is to offer a collection of public-domain implementations for commonly used cryptographic algorithms. Please be aware that this project is provided "AS IS" and was developed as a learning experience.

## Disclaimer

This repository is intended for educational and informational purposes only. The cryptographic algorithm implementations contained herein are not guaranteed to be secure for production use, and their usage is solely at your own risk. The developers do not assume any responsibility for the consequences of using these implementations in real-world applications.

## Motivation

The motivation behind QCrypto is to provide a resource for individuals interested in learning about cryptographic algorithms through practical implementation. By offering public-domain implementations, we aim to foster a collaborative environment for exploration and experimentation within the realm of cryptography.
